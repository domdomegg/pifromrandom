# Pi from random pairs of numbers
A small webapp to calculate pi from random pairs of numbers as per [Matt Parkers method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU). It should work fine on a smartphone as the code is fairly simple.

This project is not affliated or endorsed by Matt Parker in any way, I just thought the method was awesome.
